Welcome to the Code and Coffee DevOps syllabus. This document is
designed so for people with computer science backgrounds to map out
their careers in DevOps.

There are 6 sections to this document:
 - Prerequisites - What you should be able to do before getting
   serious with DevOps
 - Core Fundamentals - What you'd expect any professional DevOps
   person to know
 - Recommended - Skills that are good to have for DevOps
   professionals, especially if you want to get into the big 3
   (Amazon, Facebook, and Google)
 - Specialization - Branches of DevOps you can specialize in to be
   more marketable
 - Getting the Job - Tips to get that first DevOps job
 - Career Advice - Tips for people after they start their careers in
   DevOps

There are a couple of disciplines to consider in this document:
 - Marketability is what we care about. We care about the skills/tools
   that will help people to get a job, not necessarily the "best"
   tools. For example: Mongo has a bit of a reputation. It ranges from
   "it's fine", to "it was spawned from the deepest trenches of
   hell". We decided to put it over Couch or Cassandra for the
   document database section even though they have arguably better
   reputations because Mongo is in higher demand.
 - The more important a skill/tool, the clearer it should be on the
   syllabus. Bad example: saying "Learn Linux". Learning Linux can
   mean anything from playing around with the CLI or making changes to
   the Linux kernel repro. Good example: saying "Read the UNIX and
   Linux System Administration Handbook". This is a very clear and
   tangible goal that not only defines what you need to know but also
   how well you need to know it.
 - When there is more than way to do something, recommend the most
   marketable one and offer the others as alternative.
 - Technologies wax and wane so when deciding to include something ask
   yourself "Will this still be marketable 1 year from now". If the
   answer is yes, include it.
 - No nerd wars in this document please. The answer to vim vs emacs is
   vim, emacs or nano.
